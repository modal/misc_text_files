Mentor Schematic Difference Viewing

1.  Capture schematics to a JPG using Imageprinter or similar tool at the same
    scaling.  It is best if these are BLACK and WHITE images.
2.  Open JPGs as layers in a Paint.net Project
3.  Set old image to lower layer
4.  Set new image to upper layer
5.  Adjust curves for new image to all green
6.  Adjust curves for old image to all red
7.  Invert colors colords in old image
8.  Set blending method to XOR for both layers
9.  The parts of image are as follows:
    GREEN   NEW Portion
    RED     OLD Portion
    Blue    Where the New and Old Portions match
10. To save image, flatten the DIFF'ed image

Other methods :
B&W just view differences not colored
1.  Invert colors of one image
2.  Make set blending method of each layer to XOR

B&W poppy image
1.  Make set blending method of each layer to XOR
2.  Instead of Inverting the colors shift the output histogram darkside down
    or lightside up.
